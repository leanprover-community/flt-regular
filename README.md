# Fermat's Last Theorem for regular primes
The goal of this project is to prove Fermat's Last Theorem for [regular primes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_prime)
in [Lean](https://leanprover-community.github.io/). Here is a draft [blueprint](https://leanprover-community.github.io/flt-regular/) and  [dependency graph](https://leanprover-community.github.io/flt-regular/dep_graph.html).

To get the project just do
```
leanproject get flt-regular
```
